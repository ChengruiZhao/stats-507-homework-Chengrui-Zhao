# The course is mainly related to python programming, beginning with introduction to programming in Python. Next, the focus is on Pythonâ€™s scientific computing stack, such as numpy, scipy, pandas, and scikit-learn. Also, methods about how to use git, some general debugging and profiling techniques are discussed. The final part of the course is an introduction to deep learning using PyTorch. The purpose of this repository is that it not only records my process to learn python (especially in this class), but also a proof to companies about my ability while applying for jobs
